![Project Banner Placeholder](https://github.com/vaibhavbari412/Flipkart_Analysis-SQL_project/blob/main/flipkart.jpg)

Welcome to my SQL project, where I analyze real-time data from **Flipkart**! This project uses a dataset of **20,000+ sales records** and additional tables for payments, products, and shipping data to explore and analyze e-commerce transactions, product sales, and customer interactions. The project aims to solve business problems through SQL queries, helping Flipkart make informed decisions.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates essential SQL skills by analyzing e-commerce data from **Flipkart**, focusing on sales, payments, products, and customer data. Through SQL, we answer critical business questions, uncover trends, and derive actionable insights that help improve business strategies and customer experiences. The project covers different SQL techniques including **Joins**, **Group By**, **Aggregations**, and **Date Functions**.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing e-commerce transactions, product details, customer information, and shipping status.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding e-commerce sales and performance.

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on sales, payments, products, and customer data.

## ðŸŸ¢ Easy Level:

---

### 1. List Customers and Products Purchased
Retrieve a list of all customers with their corresponding product names they ordered.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON p.product_id = s.product_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

---

### 2. Find All Orders Placed in 2023
List all orders that were placed in the year 2023.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023;
```

---

### 3. Find Orders without Shipping Records
List all orders and their shipping status, including orders with no shipping records.

```sql
SELECT s.order_id, s.product_id, sp.shipping_id, sp.delivery_status
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN shippings sp ON sp.order_id = s.order_id
ORDER BY 3;
```

---

### 4. Find Customers Who Have Not Made Any Payments
Retrieve a list of customers who have not made any payment for their orders.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, s.order_id
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN payments pm ON pm.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE pm.order_id IS NULL;
```

## ðŸ”¶ Medium to Hard Level:

---

### 1. Total Sales Per Customer in Delhi Exceeding â‚¹50,000
Find total sales per customer in Delhi where the order status is 'Completed' and total sales exceed â‚¹50,000.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name,
       SUM(s.quantity * s.price_per_unit)
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE c.state = 'Delhi' AND s.order_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(s.quantity * s.price_per_unit) > 50000
ORDER BY 2;
```

---

### 2. Average Payment Value for Customers with More than 3 Orders
Retrieve customers who placed more than 3 orders along with their average payment value.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name,
       COUNT(s.order_id) AS total_order,
       AVG(s.quantity * s.price_per_unit) AS avg_payment_value
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN payments pm ON pm.order_id = s.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(s.order_id) > 3;
```

---

### 3. Total Sales by Product Category Exceeding â‚¹1,00,000
